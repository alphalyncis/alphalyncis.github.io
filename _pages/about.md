I am a 2nd year PhD student in Astronomy working with Beth Biller at University of Edinburgh. My thesis is centered on direct imaging characterization of brown dwarfs and giant exoplanet analogs. I am interested in studying the weather of these exoworlds using time-resolved spectroscopic observations, both from the ground and using JWST.

Weather map of the nearest brown dwarfs WISE 1049AB
------
I am applying the technique of Doppler imaging to produce global weather maps of the benchmark brown dwarf binary WISE 1049AB (aka Luhman 16 AB), using high resolution time-resolved spectra take by Gemini/IGRINS in H and K bands.

Check out my recent paper on IGRINS Doppler imaging of WISE 1049AB: [coming soon]

Monitoring weather on L/T transition brown dwarfs with JWST
------
I am working on reducing and analyzing the JWST NIRSpec + MIRI spectroscopic monitoring observations of WISE 1049AB (ID: GO 2965, PI: Beth Biller), aka Luhman 16 AB. This program aims to identify the source driving the variability observed on these two benchmark objects spanning the L/T transition by looking at the distinct variability behaviours at different wavelengths, which probes different pressure levels in their atmospheres.

Observability of Forming Planets and their Circumplanetary Disks with JWST & ELT
------
For my master thesis project I worked with Prof. Judit Szulagyi at ETH Zurich. I simulated JWST & ELT observations of circumplanetary disks using hydrodynamic simulation output and RADMC3D radiative transfer calculations.
