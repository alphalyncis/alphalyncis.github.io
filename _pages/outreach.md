Teaching for Development in Africa with Radio Astronomy
------

I am part of the [DARA](https://www.dara-project.org/) Basic Training Programme where I assist in the optical astronomy and data reduction school in Kenya. In September 2024, I worked at the Turkana Basin Institute at Ileret, Kenya and helped with the observing and data reduction with the 40 cm optical telescope permanently installed at TBI-Ileret.
