Teaching for Development in Africa with Radio Astronomy
------

I am part of the [DARA](https://www.dara-project.org/) Basic Training Programme where I assisted in the optical astronomy and data reduction school in Kenya. In September 2024, I was at the Turkana Basin Institute at Ileret, Kenya to help with the observing and data reduction using the 40 cm optical telescope permanently installed at TBI-Ileret.
